### 2011 ==旅程之“余”==

![image-20241029135202111](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031736.png)

**这是一幅简单但具有讽刺性的漫画.在一艘小小的游船上有两个游客，欣赏着眼前的自然美景同时把垃圾丢进水里。**

> This is a simple but ironic[^讽刺的] cartoon/drawing. On a traveling boat, there are two youngsters/ visitors/tourists, enjoying=appreciating=admiring=watching the natural beauty in front and throwing rubbish into the water/lake/river. 

**尽管这是个旅游景点，游客身后的湖水变得又脏又臭，里面飘着塑料瓶、塑料袋、鱼骨头和西瓜皮。**

> Although this is a tourist attraction/scenic spot, the lake water behind tourists becomes exceedingly[^非常] dirty and smelly/nasty/disgusting, with plastic bottles and bags, fish bones and watermelon peels floating on it. 

**最后，我们也注意到几个汉字，其内容是：这是一个 “ 扔垃圾 ” 的旅程。**

> Then, we can also notice several Chinese characters, which say/read that this is a trip of “discarding garbage/waste”. 

**上述场景，显然，能联系到一些游客的素质问题，而且他们的所作所为的典型特征就在于其对环境的破坏。**

> Such a scenario/scene above can be naturally[^显然] associated with=related/linked to the issue of some tourists’ quality, and these behaviors are characterized/marked by their damage/pollution to the environment. 

**不得不承认,在当今的中国，一些游客的恶劣行为曾经被各种媒体报道，例如随处扔垃圾，在公共场所抽烟和大声喧哗。**

> Admittedly, in contemporary China, some[^许多] travelers’/tourists' bad/terrible/awful behaviors have been reported in various[^各种] media, such as throwing/leaving rubbish everywhere, smoking and talking loudly in public places. 

**这种现象很值得关注，因为这些游客只关注自身旅程的舒适和享受,忽略了公共美德的重要性。**

> This phenomenon is particularly[^非常] worth attention for the reason that these tourists/individuals/ people may merely/just care about their own enjoyment and comfort in trip, ignoring the significance of public virtue. 

**事实上,正是他们这种不道德行为致使他人无法享受到干净清新的景致。**

> As a matter of fact,[^事实上] It is this uncivilized/immoral behavior/practice/action that causes others not to enjoy clean/tidy/neat and clear landscape. 

**因此，作为一个年轻人,我认为,游客应该遵守相关规定，去爱、尊重和保护我们共同的家园——地球。同时，整个社会应该营造积极的氛围，去倡导和遵守公共美德。**

> Accordingly, as a youngster, I deem that[^我相信] it is advisable for tourists to follow=abide by=obey related regulations and to love, respect and protect our common homeland—the earth. Meanwhile, society as a whole should foster a positive atmosphere to advocate and obey public virtues/moralities.

### 2012  ==乐观悲观==

![image-20241029151355760](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031737.png)

**漫画中，一个悲观的小伙站在一个翻倒在地上的瓶子的旁边，脸上带着绝望，说出了一句评论：“全完了。”**

> In the cartoon, a pessimistic guy stands beside an over-turned bottle, with great desperation on his face, uttering a remark/ crying ： “It’s over/ screwed up.” 

**而另一个年轻人则弯腰去捡起瓶子，脸上带着兴奋和喜悦，评论道： “还好，还剩点。”尽管他们看到的是同一个瓶子，但这两个人的反应完全不同。**

> However, the other youngster stoops down to pick up the bottle, with great joy and excitement, commenting: “Nice, there is still something left.” Although they see the same bottle, these two men’s reactions totally differ.

**上述场景，显然，能联想到对面逆境时两种截然不同的态度——乐观和悲观。**

> Such a scenario, apparently[^显然], can be associated with two distinct=total/completely different attitudes toward/for the adversity[^逆境]—pessimism and optimism. 

**不得不承认,在现实生活中，有很多年轻人就像图中左边的小男孩一样，在困难面前失去信心。这种现象很值得关注，因为他们可能只关注困难，甚至夸大情况。**

> Admittedly, in reality=in the real life, so many[^许多] young people, like the left boy in the picture, tend to lose confidence in front of setbacks. This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that they may merely see the hazard, and even exaggerate it.

**正是他们的悲观心态导致他们看不到希望，看不到机会，也看不到改变的希望。**

> It is their pessimistic/negative/bad/terrible/passive/awful attitude/mindset that causes them to see no hope, no chance or no possibility of change. 

**事实上,这种消极的想法已经构成一种障碍,阻碍着许多年轻的个人的成功与成长.**

> As a matter of fact, this passive thought has constituted an obstacle that hinders a great many young individuals' personal growth and progress.

**在我看来，乐观就是一条通往成功的道路。一个典型例子就是我自己。作为一名正在考研的大四学生，我几乎每天都会遭遇各种挑战。然而，乐观的心态带给我力量，唤起我奋斗的热情，帮助我战胜困难。**

> To my understanding/From my point of view, optimism can be likened to a journey, which leads to success. A case in point is me. As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for 
>
> postgraduate studies, I encounter diverse[^各种] challenges nearly every day. Anyway, an optimistic 
>
> mind brings me power, arouses my passion for striving and helps me conquer hardships. 

**总之，每个人都应该牢记：机会来源于积极乐观的心态**

> In a nutshell, everyone should bear in mind that opportunities originate from a positive and optimistic mind. 

### 2013 ==毕业选择==

![image-20241029154025530](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031738.png)

**这是一幅简单但值得深思的图片：一群毕业生站在很多选择的面前，盯着他们前方的各个方向——就业、考研、出国和创业。**

> This is a simple but enlightening cartoon: in front of many choices stand a host of[^许多] graduates, staring at various directions/choices/options before them—hunting for jobs, furthering their study as postgraduates, studying abroad and creating/starting/establishing their own businesses/firms/companies. 

**尽管选择是多样的，但是这些年轻人却不知道怎么选，脸上是巨大的困惑。最后，可以注意到两个汉字，内容是 “ 选择 ”。**

> Although there are diverse[^各种] options, these youngsters do not know how to choose, with great confusion on their faces. Finally, two Chinese characters can be noticed, which say “choices” .

**上述场景使我们自然而然的联想到了现实生活中很多困惑的年轻人。**

> Such a scenario, apparently[^显然], can be naturally associated with a great many confused young people in real life. 

**具体来讲，越来越多的大学生在毕业必须选择时变得困惑。这种趋势非常值得关注，因为很多大学过于关注学生的学术研究，忽略职业引导的重要性。**

> To be specific, an increasing/growing number of college students get puzzled when they have to make choices after graduation. This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that many universities may focus merely on students’ academic study, ignoring the importance of the career guidance. 

**正是这种忽视导致他们对未来没有清晰的目标和计划.**

> It is schools’ neglect that causes young people to possess inadequate competence or confidence to make intelligent choices. 

**因此，每个大学应该营造鼓励和帮助大学生提前做职业规划的培养的意识。**

> Accordingly, every university should foster a positive atmosphere to help and encourage youngsters to make career plans in advance. 

**于我而言，我选择为考研做准备。这个选择具有挑战性，但我认为这一过程必将带给我改变的机会，唤起我对学习的热情，大大提升自我。**

> For me, I choose to prepare for the national entrance examination for postgraduate studies. This is a challenging choice, but I deem this process will definitely bring me opportunity to change, arouse my enthusiasm for study and enhance myself to a large extent.

> The above drawings emphasize the harmony and happiness of a mother and her daughter. Three decades ago, the young mother held/took her little lovely angel’s/daughter/girl hand, walking on a road, with sweet smiles on their faces. 

**如今，尽管妈妈已经年迈女儿已长大成人，她们依旧享受同样的幸福。最后，两个汉字解释了图片的寓意—“相携”。**

> Now, although the mom becomes aged and the daughter has grown up, they still enjoy the same happiness. Finally, two Chinese characters interpret the intended meaning, namely, “mutual supporting”.

**这种常见的情景尤其值得关注，因为图画的作者关注的是传统的中国美德：尊老爱幼，这是幸福家庭的显著特征。**

> This common scene is particularly worth attention for the reason that the drawer focuses on the traditional Chinese virtues ： filial piety and loving kids, which characterize a happy family.

**孝心带给年老的父母力量，唤起他们对生活的热爱，帮助他们安度晚年。**

> Filial piety/Children's love brings the aged parents power, arouses their enthusiasm for life and helps them enjoy happiness an joy. 

**同时，明智的家长都意识到爱子女的重要性。因此，很多中国家庭都普遍期待为老人和孩子营造和谐的氛围。**

> Meanwhile, intelligent parents in large numbers have realized the significance of loving children. Thus, it has become a common expectation for a host of families in China to forge a harmonious atmosphere for both children and aged parents.

**他们之间的相携使得年轻人和老人都得到了长久的幸福。图片中的妈妈和女儿就是一个典型例子。**

> It is their mutual supporting that enables both the young and the senior to acquire long-time happiness. A case in point the mother and her daughter in the pictures.

**作为一名大学生，我相信每一个中国家庭都有必要保持这种传统美德。因此，无论有多忙，年轻人应该预留足够的时间陪伴年迈的父母，因为没有父母的支持，年轻人不可能长大成人。**

> As a college student, I am convinced that[^我相信] it is of vital necessity for[^应该] every family in China to preserve/inherit/follow/learn this traditional virtue. Accordingly, it is advisable for youngsters to spare/ allocate adequate time to accompany their old parents, no matter how busy they are, because without parents’ supporting, it is impossible for young people to grow up.

### 2015 ==手机时代的聚餐==

![image-20241029172016926](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031741.png)

**这是一幅简单但有启发性的漫画.具体来说, 在一餐桌旁边坐着四位年轻人，他们盯着自己的智能手机，桌子上的美味食物丝毫未动。**

> This is a simple but enlightening cartoon .To be specific=To be elaborate, beside a table sit four youngsters, staring/looking at=focusing on their smart cell phones, with tasty/delicious foods uneaten.

**尽管他们为了友情而聚餐，但他们几乎没有交流。最后，还给了几个汉字，内容为“手机时代的聚餐”。**

> Although they gather to enhance/for friendship, scarcely do these guys chat/communicate/talk with each other. Finally, several Chinese characters are given, which say/read “dinning together in the era of cell phones”.

**显然，这种情节能自然联系到手机在年轻人中的过度使用。事实上，手机已经构成一种障碍，阻碍着人们的正常交流。**

> Such a scenario, apparently,[^显然] can be associated with the excessive use of cell phones among teenagers. As a matter of fact, cell phones have constituted an obstacle that hinders people’s normal communication.

**一个典型例子：像图画中的年轻人一样，很多年轻人花费太多时间在手机上网、聊天或其评论他人的微信。**

>  A case in point is that a host of youngsters, like the guys in the picture, spend much time on [ allocate ... to ... ] mobile phones to surf the Internet, chat with friends or comment others’ We-chats. 

**这种趋势很值得关注，因为他们沉溺于虚拟的世界，忽略了真实生活。**

> This trend/phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that they are addicted to = indulge themselves in =be obsessed with the virtual world, ignoring the real life.

**因此,手机可以被比喻为一把双刃剑,一方面,手机带给我们巨大的便利,激发我们对数字产品的热情,帮助我们紧跟这个飞速变化的时代.另一方面,也是过度使用手机导致人与人之间变得冷漠.**

> Thus, cell phones can be likened to a double-edged sword .For one thing, they bring us tremendous convenience, inspire our passion for digital products, and help us to catch up with = adapt to this fast-changing era/time/age. For another, it is excessive use of cell phones that causes the interpersonal relationship to become cold or indifferent.

**所有手机用户应该牢记：手机只是工具。我认为年轻人当手机的奴隶是不明智的。**

> All phone users should bear in mind that cell phones are just tools. I am convinced that[^我相信] it is not advisable for youngsters to be slave of mobile phones. 

**因此，我们应该理性使用现代科技产品，像网络、手机、电视和计算机等。**

> Accordingly, we should[^应该] utilize modern technological products rationally=in a rational manner , including the Internet, cell phones, TV and computers.

### 2016 ==给孩子做个榜样==

![image-20241029174818335](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031742.png)

**这是两幅简单但具有启发性的漫画. 在第一个图中，一个父亲坐在电脑前打游戏并鼓励自己的儿子努力学习，但是孩子没有任何行动。**

> These are two simple but enlightening cartoons. In the first cartoon, there is a father/dad, sitting in front of a computer, playing games and urging/asking/requiring/ordering his son to work hard, but the youngster takes no action. 

**相反，在第二个图中，当爸爸也开始学习时，尽管他不再要求孩子学习，孩子反而专心学习了。最后，能注意到若干汉字，其内容为“与其只提要求，不如做个榜样。”**

> By contrast,[^相反] in the second one, although the father does not require his kid to study, the child concentrates on/focus on learning / study attentively when his dad begins to learn. Finally, several Chinese characters can be noticed/noted, which say/read that instead of merely requiring, parents should be models for children. 

**这样的两幅图很值得注意，因为其关注的是父母在生活和学习中如何教育孩子。不得不承认, 在当今中国，越来越多家长要求孩子努力取得学习的成功，但他们却给孩子树立负面的榜样。典型例子就是左图中的爸爸。**

> These two pictures are particularly worth attention for the reason that they focus on how parents should educate their kids in life and study. Admittedly, in contemporary China, it has become a trend for an increasing number of parents to demand their teenagers to work hard for academic success, but/while they set negative/bad/terrible examples. A case in point is the father in the left picture. 

**在我理解，榜样的力量是无穷的。作为积极的榜样，父母带给孩子力量，唤起他们对生活的热情，帮助他们培养积极的习惯。**

> To my understanding, the strength of role models is infinite. As positive models, parents can bring kids power/right directions, arouse their enthusiasm for study , and help them to foster=cultivate=develop=have=form positive/nice/good/better habits.

**不幸的是，很多家长的负面行为已经构成了阻碍孩子成长进步的障碍。**

> Unfortunately, many[^许多] parents’ bad behaviors have constituted an obstacle that hinders kids’ growth and progress. 

**作为一名大学生，我坚信家长有必要通过恰当的行为来提升他们对孩子的积极影响。同时，社会应该营造健康氛围来批判和拒绝父母对子女的消极影响。**

> As a college student, I am convinced that[^我相信] it is of great necessity for[^应该] parents to enhance their positive impacts on children by behaving appropriately. Meanwhile, society as a whole should forge a positive atmosphere to criticize and reject parents’ negative examples for kids. 

### 2017 ==“有书”与“读书”==

![image-20241029181313684](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031743.png)

**在第一幅漫画中，有一个年轻人，悠闲地坐在沙发上炫耀自己海量的藏书，手里却一本书都没有。**

> In the first cartoon, there is a youngster, sitting leisurely in a chair and flaunting=showing off=displaying=boasting his large number of[^许多] books, with no book in hands. 

**然而，在右图中，尽管那位小伙只有几本书，但他却下定决心要尽全力一年内读 20 本书。最后，能注意到几个汉字，其内容是：“有书”与“读书”。**

> However/Nonetheless, in the right picture, although the guy/boy has just a few books, he has made his mind to=decided to=is determined to do his utmost[^尽最大努力] to read 20 books in this year. Several Chinese characters, finally, can be noticed, which say “having books” and “reading books”. 

**这两幅图片很值得关注，因为画家关注的是什么是真正的阅读。**

> These two pictures are particularly worth attention for the reason that the painter focuses on what the true reading is.

**在当今社会，很多人喜欢买书、藏书、甚至炫耀书，但他们从来不读书。这种现象是可笑的。**

> In the contemporary/current/present-day society, a host of[^许多] people prefer to purchase, store and even flaunt their books, but they may never read any books. This phenomenon is rather ridiculous. 

**事实上，每个人都应该牢记：书是用来读的不是用来吹牛皮的。**

> As a matter of fact,[^事实上] everyone should[^应该] bear in mind that books should be read and not be boasted. 

**作为一种好习惯，读书会带给我们知识，唤起我们对未来的热情，帮助我们提升自身的素质。**

> Reading books, as a positive habit, brings us abundant[^丰富] knowledge, arouses our enthusiasm for future life and enhances our quality.

**正是读书使得我们不仅学到知识，还获得了面对逆境的自信、乐观和勇气。**

> It is books that enable us to acquire/accumulate not only knowledge, but also confidence, optimism and courage to face/meet/conquer any adversity.

**作为一名大学生，我认为，整个社会应该形成一种积极的氛围，去鼓励和教育所有人不仅仅买书还要专心读书。**

> I, as a college student, am convinced that[^我相信] society as a whole should foster a positive atmosphere to educate and encourage all people/citizens to not only purchase books, but also to be absorbed in  =concentrate on =focus on reading books=read attentively. 

**毕竟, 书籍可以被比作人类进步的阶梯.**

> After all, books can be likened to the ladder of/for human progress.

### 2018 ==选课进行时==

![image-20241029183754037](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031744.png)

**这个漫画显然能被联系到影响大学生选课的各种因素.** 

> This drawing apparently can be associated with diverse factors which affect a college student's choice/option for electives/courses. 

**一个年轻人坐在选课系统班的前面，思考着两组特征——右边这组包括“给高分、易通过、作业少”；左边的这组涉及“知识新、重创新、有难度”。**

> A youngster sits in front of a course selection system, pondering over two groups of characteristics—the right one includes (easy access to) high scores, less difficulties in passing the test=being easy to pass the test and less assignments; the left one involves the latest knowledge, emphasis on/focusing on innovation/ creation or more challenging requirements. 

**最后，可以注意到几个汉字，其内容是“选课进行时”。**

> Finally, several Chinese characters can be noticed, which say that it is time to choose the elective/ course. 

**上述场景很值得关注，因为一些学生可能很关注的所谓的“容易”，忽略了他们能学到什么。**

> Such a scenario is particularly[^非常] worth attention for the reason that some students may focus much on the so-called “ease”, ignoring/overlooking/neglecting what they can acquire.

**事实上，他们的这种肤浅且短视行为已经构成了一种障碍，阻碍着他们的进步与成长。**

> As a matter of fact,[^事实上] their superficial and short-sighted behaviors/deeds/choices have constituted an obstacle that hinders/impairs/undermines/harms their growth and progress. 

**正是这些课程能够使得青少年获得竞争力并追赶上社会进步的快节奏.**

> It is these courses that enable teenagers to gain/obtain/enhance competitive edge and keep up with the fast=rapid pace of social development/advancement. 

**作为一名正在准备考研的大四学生, 我偏爱具有挑战性的任务，因为在我看来，这样的课程将带给我学习的动力，唤起我对学术成功的渴望热情，帮我扩宽视野。**

> As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduate studies, I prefer challenging tasks, since these courses, to my understanding, can bring me motivation to learn, arouse my passion for academic success and help me broaden my horizons

### 2019 ==爬山==

![image-20241029191311345](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031746.png)

**显然，该图能联想到面对逆境时的两种截然不同的态度。**

> This drawing, apparently,[^显然] can be associated with=linked/related/connected to two distinct=completely/totally different attitudes in front of adversities[^逆境]. 

**具体来讲, 在一条通往大山的路上，有一个年轻人，坐着休息的同时还叹气道，“累了，我不爬了。”相反，他同伴鼓励他休息后继续坚持。**

> To be specific, on a journey/path/road/way to a high mountain, there is a youngster, sitting for a rest and sighing/saying/commenting/complaining, “I am too tired/exhausted to climb.” By contrast[^相反], his partner encourages him to continue=keep going after a rest/break. 

**最后，我们注意到两个汉字，内容是“途中”。**

> Two Chinese characters, finally, can be noticed, which say/read “on the journey/road/path”.

**成功人士的特征就在于他们身上包括乐观, 勤奋, 坚强的意志力和持之以恒在内的各种优秀素质。**

> Successful individuals are featured with/characterized by their various excellent qualities, including 
>
> optimism, diligence, strong wills and the spirit of perseverance=persistence( the spirit of never abandon/giving up).

**然而，在现实生活中，很多年轻人在追求成功的过程中遭遇挑战时往往会放弃。**

> However, a host of young people, in reality, tend to give up when encountering/meeting/having challenges[^逆境] during the pursuit of success. 

**这种现象非常值得关注。在我看来，坚持能被比喻为一把打开成功大门的钥匙。**

> This phenomenon is particularly worth attention and to my understanding, persistence can be likened to a key, unlocking the gate of success.

**一个典型的例子就是我自己。作为一个正在准备研究生入学考试的大四同学，我坚信持之以恒带给我力量，唤起我对未来的想往，帮我克服了如此多困难。**

> A case in point is me. As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduate, I am firmly convinced that perseverance always brings me power/motivation, arouses my enthusiasm for the future and helps me conquer so many hardships. 

**事实上，“放弃”这种想法已经构成了一种障碍，阻碍着很多人在工作、生活和学习中的成长和进步。**

> As a matter of fact,[^事实上] the thought of “giving up” may constituted an obstacle that hinders many people’s long-term growth and progress in work, life and study. 

**因此，每个人都应牢记：永不放弃，你才会最终实现梦想。**

> Thus, everyone should bear in mind that “Never give up, you will eventually achieve your dreams.”

### 2020 ==习惯==

![image-20241029193718765](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031747.png)

**显然，这两幅图能联系到两种截然不同的习惯。**

> These two drawings, apparently,[^显然] can be associated with two distinct habits.

**左图中，书桌旁有一个女孩儿，专注学习的同时，大脑中还在想：“应尽早完成。”**

> In the left one, there is a girl beside a desk, being absorbed in/concentrating on learning=learning attentively, with an idea in her mind—it is advisable to[^应该] complete as early/soon as possible. . 

**形成对比的，右图中，一个男孩儿悠哉悠哉地坐在沙发上，告诉自己：“不到最后不动手。”最后，两个汉字能被注意到，其内容是：习惯。**

> By contrast,[^相反] in the right picture, a young guy sits leisurely in a sofa, telling himself, “I need not act/take action until the deadline.” Finally, two Chinese characters can be noticed, which say “habit”

**成功人士的特征通常是他们的众多优点，包括勤奋、持之以恒和每天努力。**

> Successful figures are usually characterized by their diverse[^各种] merits, including diligence, perseverance and striving every day. 

**然而，不得不承认, 在现实生活中，很多年轻人习惯于直到最后一天才会有行动。**

> However/Nonetheless, admittedly, in reality, a host of youngsters are accustomed to=tend to taking no action until the last day. 

**这种糟糕的习惯很值得关注，而且事实上，他们的懒惰已经构成了一种障碍，阻碍着其个人的成长和进步。**

> This terrible habit/phenomenon is particularly worth attention and as a matter of fact[^事实上], their laziness has constituted an obstacle that hinders[^阻碍] their personal growth and progress. 

**在我看来，我们应该每天按时完成当天的任务。这种好习惯能被比喻成一条路，通向成功和美好未来。**

> To my understanding, we are supposed to accomplish our assignments on time each day. This good/positive habit can be likened to a journey, leading to success and a promising future. 

**一个典型例子就是我。在过去的这一年，作为一名一直在为考研做准备的大四学生，我从未将当天的任务拖延至第二天。这种好习惯确保了我学习的动力，带给我力量，帮助我每天积累知识。**

> A case in point is myself. During the past year, as a senior who has been preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduate studies, I have never postponed/delayed/put off one day’s task until the next day. This excellent habit ensures my motivation for learning, brings me power and helps me accumulate knowledge every day. 

**总之，今日事今日毕。同时，每个人都应该牢记：一个好习惯是一生的财富。**

> To conclude, never put off till tomorrow what you can do today. Meanwhile, every one should bear in mind that a positive habit means a lifelong treasure.

### 2021 ==做自己喜欢的事==

![image-20241029193801759](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wanglihan954/Image/202410292031748.png)

**这是一幅简单但有启发性的漫画。图画中，有个年轻人，很失望地抱怨说：“我想学戏曲，但朋友说这很无趣。”**

> This is a simple but enlightening/thought-provoking cartoon, in which there is a youngster, with great disappointment/confusion/upset/puzzle on his face, complaining, “I want to learn the traditional opera, but my friend told me that it is boring.” 

**然后，他的爸爸就鼓励他，说：“你喜欢，才是最重要的。”**

> Then, his father encourages him, “What does matter is that you like it.”

**显然，这位父亲的鼓励能联系到一个人坚持梦想的重要性。**

> However, in reality, so many[^许多] young people, like the boy in the picture, tend to be=are often affected/impacted/influenced by others’ opinions and even give up/abandon what they really want/hope /want to pursue.
